# Web design guidelines - Typography, colors, images, icons, spacing and layout

## Beautiful typography
1. Use a font-size between 15 and 25 pixels for body text.
2. Use (really) big font sizes for headlines.
    - Decrease font weight when you use very big font sizes.   
3. Use a line spacing between 120 and 150% of the font size.
4. 45 to 90 characters per line.
5. Use good fonts.
6. Choose a font which reflects the look and feel you want for your website.
7. Use only one font.

## Using colors like a pro
1. Use only one base color.
2. Use a tool if you want to use more colors.
3. Use color to draw attention.
4. Never use black in your design.
5. Choose colors wisely. There are psychological effects behind each color and they make a great difference in web design.

## Working with images
1. Put text directly on the image.
    - Only works when the image is dark and the text is white.
2. Overlay the image.
3. Put your text in a box.
4. Blur the image.
5. Use floor fade.
    - Image fades towards black at the bottom, with white text written over it.

## Working with icons
1. Use icons to list features/steps.
2. Use icons for actions and links.
3. Icons should be recognizable.
4. Label your icons.
5. Icons should not take center stage.
6. Use icon **fonts** whenever possible.
    - They scale endlessly and therefore don't blur.

## Spacing and layout
> User Experience is **how it works**

1. Put whitespace between your
    - elements
    - group of elements
    - website's sections.
2. Define where you want your audience to look first.
3. Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message.
    - When you design a hierarchy, you walk your users through the content's message.
4. Use whitespace to build that flow.
    - Whitespace is key to creating a clean and simple look.

## General advice
- When you're starting out with web design, you should not worry so much about originality.
- Without inspiration, it's hard to start anything.
- You don't have to reinvent website layouts and user interface elements.
- It is useful to analyze HTML and CSS code of well designed websites.
